# 🧠 YOLOv3 Real-Time Object Detection with OpenCV

This project uses the **YOLOv3 deep learning model** to perform real-time object detection on webcam video input using **OpenCV** and **Python**.

---

## 📸 Features

- Real-time object detection from webcam
- Uses YOLOv3 pretrained weights and config
- Detects 80 common objects (COCO dataset)
- Bounding boxes with class labels and confidence scores

## 📁 Files Required

- `yolov3.cfg` – YOLOv3 configuration file  
- `yolov3.weights` – YOLOv3 pretrained weights  
- `coco.names` – COCO dataset class names  
- `object_detection.py` – Main Python script (your code)


## 🛠️ Requirements

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
